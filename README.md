## About me

I am a PhD Researcher in the Applied Data Mining group (Department of Engineering Management, Faculty of Business & Economics) at the University of Antwerp. My supervisor is [Prof. dr. ir. David Martens](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/david-martens/){:target="_blank"}. I work on *Explainable AI and Data Science Ethics*. In my research I am focused on *Data Science Ethics and Explainable AI* in specific. How can we make AI more aligned with our ethical objectives by being able to explain it?
In 2019, I obtained a Master's degree in Business Engineering from the KULeuven, and in 2020, I obtained a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, also from KULeuven.
